# ComputerVisionFinal
Final Project for Deep Learning Application II: Computer Vision

The repository contains the code to train a Conformer in a supervised manner and pre-train Conformer using SimCLR and fine-tune it on any dataset. The code also includes scripts to visualize the feature maps for conformer and perform a T-SNE analysis. Finally, I also include the code to train a Conformer using DINO.
